## Summary

This document provides an overview, project spec, and wireframes for our team's capstone project: An app that **The Calorie App is intended to display a list of all of the food the user answered yes to consuming as well as the total amount of calories the user will be intaking. 

The Calorie App will fetch data such as the food image, food name, and the amount of calories the food contains from a Food API. The App will ask the user if they would like to consume the food being displayed. If the user answers yes, the food will be added in a RecyclerView. At any time the user can click the end button which will be available towards the bottom of the page. Once the user clicks end, the application will display a RecycleView which contains all of the food the user answered yes to.**

If we had to describe this milestone in three (3) emojis, they would be: **👍🏻👌🏻🙌🏻💪🏻**
