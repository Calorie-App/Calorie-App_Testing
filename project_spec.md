## App Overview

The CalorieCalc is a powerful tool designed to help users easily track and manage their daily caloric intake. Whether you're looking to maintain a healthy lifestyle, lose weight, or gain muscle, CalorieCalc provides real-time feedback on your calorie consumption, helping you stay on track with your nutrition goals.

### Description

**The CalorieCalc will fetch data such as the food name, the amount of calories, and other nutrients details from a Food API. The App will ask the user if they would like to consume the food being displayed. If the user answers yes, the food will be added to a RecyclerView. The user will be able to add food to the RecyclerView until his/her calorie intake goal for the day is met. Once the calorie goal is met, the application will display a RecycleView which contains all of the food the user answered yes to consuming.**
